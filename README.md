- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrzywN

- 👀 I’m interested in programming and coding.
  I used to make automation scripts in autohothey and than I started to learn C++ and HTML/CSS. In the same time I was learning JavaScript.
  My current project is to make professional (as fas as I can) website for my family's local business. Hopefully I'll do more serious and advanced projects in the future.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make professional, coded websites using HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript. Sometimes I programme in Java to learn more about back-end.

- 📄 My projects:
  - Pasja - Fully responsive hairdresser's website for local business (HTML, CSS, JS, BEM, Flexbox)

- 📫 To contact me, you can use my discord: fansik#2808
