- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and coding.
  I used to make automation scripts in autohothey and than I started to learn C++ and HTML/CSS. In the same time I was learning JavaScript.
  My current project is to make professional (as fas as I can) website for my family's local business. Hopefully I'll do more serious and advanced projects in the future.
